My personal fork of [Bozhidar's](https://twitter.com/bbatsov) most excellent [emacs-prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) starter-kit.

Everything in the personal directory is mine. I merge directly from prelude as an alternate remote  but only occasionally as Bozhidar is not afraid to make breaking changes. He keeps me on my toes about what's new out there in the emacs world (smart-parens, cider, etc...) and for that I'm grateful. I'm totally buying him beers if he ever shows up in Chicago.
